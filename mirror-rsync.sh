#A considerably simpler take on apt-mirror - parses the Packages files like apt-mirror, but then builds a file of .debs to download, which is then passed to rsync which does the rest.
#Saves the overhead of downloading each file over HTTP and considerably simpler to debug. Can now be configured using a file containing paths instead of running rsync many times in a loop.
#Just like apt-mirror, capable of running on only one Ubuntu release to save space.
